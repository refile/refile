      # Macro which generates accessors in Active Record classes for assigning
      # multiple attachments at once. This is primarily useful together with
      # multiple file uploads. There is also a pure Ruby version of this macro.
      #
      # The name of the generated accessors will be the name of the association
      # and the name of the attachment in the associated model. So if a `Post`
      # accepts attachments for `images`, and the attachment in the `Image`
      # model is named `file`, then the accessors will be named `images_files`.
      #
      # @example in model
      #   class Post
      #     has_many :images, dependent: :destroy
      #     accepts_attachments_for :images
      #   end

      # @example in associated model
      #   class Image
      #     attachment :file
      #   end

      # @example in form
      #   <%= form_for @post do |form| %>
      #     <%= form.attachment_field :images_files, multiple: true %>
      #   <% end %>

      # @param [Symbol]  attachment           Name of the attachment in the associated model
